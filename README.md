# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

The project I plan to build is a simple TODOList. It will allow you to add items and delete them aswell. The target audience is anyone that needs a to do list. It will manage a list of items. Once it's fully implemented, I would like to add a feature where you can add images to the task.

## Project Wireframe

TODO: Replace the wireframe below with you own design.
